My research leverages elements from neuroimaging, date science, and psychology to create statistical models that help me understand how neuro-cognitive mechanisms are altered by methamphetamine use.\nTo achieve my research goals I use a variety of software (e.g. REDCap, Excel) and programming languages (e.g. R, Bash) to create data sets that combine behavioral, cognitive, and neuroimaging data. I then use these data to create multilevel models that predict behavior such as decision making or reaction time. My hope is that by better understanding how people who use methamphetamine make decisions we can optimize treatment for addiction.\nAs a first generation colllege student and former english major, I’m also very interested in translating scientific knowlege for the lay public."

Results showed local reward context did influence choice consistency, but previous losses in a reward scarce environment had no effect in people with problematic methamphetamine use experience. Additionally, despite moment-to-moment changes in local reward availability being significantly and positively correlated with BOLD signal fluctuations in striatal regions, findings did not reveal any significant difference between the groups. Finally, people with problematic methamphetamine use experience exhibited reduced reward tracking in several areas outside of striatum compared to the control group, including regions within the frontoparietal network.

    "text": "Methamphetamine-related reductions in hippocampal volume vary by sex\n\n\n\nAs methamphetamine use rates continue to climb, understanding its relationship with physical, mental, and cognitive decline is critical. While memory difficulties are common, the underlying neurobiology of these deficits are not well understood. Preclinical work suggests that, at least among male subjects, methamphetamine exposure results in volume loss in the hippocampus, a critical brain region supporting memory outcomes. Human studies investigating the effect of methamphetamine use on hippocampal volume have been equivocal. These inconsistencies may relate to sex differences and varying degrees of use and abstinence in study samples. The current study evaluated hippocampal volume and associated hippocampal-dependent memory in a sex-balanced community sample of people with (N=90) and without (N=90) recent problematic methamphetamine-use experience. While group differences in hippocampal volumes were evident for male individuals with methamphetamine-use experience compared to a methamphetamine-naïve control group, no such differences were evident for females. However, hippocampal-dependent memory performance (i.e., delayed verbal recall performance) was impaired for both male and female individuals with methamphetamine-use experience and both hippocampal volume and methamphetamine-use experience explained unique and significant variance in memory performance. These findings highlight the importance of considering sex-differences in methamphetamine-focused research with clear implications for evaluating markers of treatment program efficacy."

Methods: CALM used mass transit and digital marketing and local community engagement strategies to reduce DUP in referrals to the Early Psychosis Intervention Clinic–New Orleans. DUP measures were collected for clinic referrals pre- and post-CALM launch (N=116). Analytics from marketing strategies were used to evaluate campaign success. Results: In the first 12 months of CALM, the mean DUP from onset of psychotic symptoms to clinic entry decreased from a median of 6.6 (interquartile range [IQR]=2.5–14.9) to 2.1 (IQR=1.1–10.7) months. Time from onset of psychotic symptoms to first antipsychotic treatment decreased from a median of 2.0 (IQR=0.5–8.6) to 0.2 (IQR=0.0–0.7) months. Conclusions: The CALM campaign produced promising results for reducing DUP in referrals to a coordinated specialty care program.\nCitation: Weiss, A., Chaudhry, S., Atiya, W., Long, S., Roy, R., & Mojtabai, R.

Research has shown the use of telehealth has improved patient engagement, medication adherence, and satisfaction. Psychiatry is poised to benefit from telehealth because individual psychotherapy and parts of medication management can be done virtually. However, some practitioners believe telehealth interferes with rapport building, detection of nonverbal ques, continuity of care, and collection of physiological data. This is a particular issue for coordinated specialty care (CSC), an evidence-based practice that relies on multiple specialties and high levels of patient engagement to improve outcomes in patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP). This study extracted data from medical records stretching across four years to compare treatments outcomes in relation to the type of care (virtual, hybrid, or in-person) the patient received. Engagement at EPIC-NOLA spiked in 2020 and stabilized in 2021 and 2022. Underlying these trends is the inclusion of telehealth and hybrid care (receiving care both in-person and by means of telehealth) as a treatment model. While this study cannot assign cause to the spike in patient engagement during 2020, it is irrefutable that telehealth facilitated engagement as it was the only way to engage at the time. The years 2021 and 2022 saw the introduction of a hybrid method of care which may explain heightened engagement levels compared with 2019. The reduction in engagement from 2020 levels in these years may reflect the end of isolation, and more opportunities for alternative interaction.\nCitation: Chaudhry, S., Roy, R., Mansourian, K., Weiss, A., & Breier, A.

However, these publications are largely absent from the social work literature. We have reviewed nine major journals for papers related to psychotic disorders and their treatment since the RAISE trials. We found that five of the nine journals had no relevant articles, two had a single article, and the remaining journals had three and four articles, respectively. The RAISE trials were not mentioned in any of the papers. These results highlight the poor visibility of psychosis in social work. Poor visibility limits social work’s ability to provide care despite its prevalence in adjacent fields.\nCitation: Chaudhry, S., Roy, R., Weiss, A., & Hansel, T. (2022).

While pair bonds are often assumed to be present after a week of cohabitation, when they actually form in this species is debated. To characterize pair bond latency in California mice, we conducted three-chamber partner preference tests for both males and females following 1, 3, 5, or 7 days of cohabitation. Since copulation may contribute to pair-bond formation, animals were paired when females were in estrus and were assessed continuously throughout the cohabitation period for copulatory behavior. We found evidence of pair bonds after 24 h of cohabitation for both sexes with no significant changes in partner preference behaviors across cohabitation periods. Focal animals spent more time in the partner’s chamber, were more affiliative toward the partner than the stranger and displayed more aggressive behavior toward the stranger. Affiliative behaviors were consistent between the sexes, while males attacked the stranger more frequently and for longer durations than females. Pairs that copulated prior to partner-preference testing spent more time in the partner’s chamber and more time huddling, licking, and grooming their mate than those that did not copulate. We conclude that although copulation may not be necessary for pair-bond formation, sexual receptivity at time of pairing is important for the development of these social relationships and that copulation may serve to enhance pair bonds in California mice.\nCitation: Roy, R., Hammerdahl, E., Sage, A., & Becker, E. A. (2025). Mating may enhance rapid formation of stable pair bonds in the monogamous California mouse. Ethology. https://doi.org/10.1111/eth.13545\n\n\nReproductive success diminished following mate loss for females but not males in a monogamous rodent\nThe strictly monogamous California mouse (Peromyscus californicus) forms life-long pair bonds and mates exclusively with a single partner. While studies in the wild indicate that individuals may re-pair with a new partner following mate loss, the preponderance of this behavior and subsequent reproductive outcomes following re-pairing are understudied. To examine reproductive outcomes following re-pairing and to look for sex-specific differences following mate loss, birth records of 584 California mouse pairs from our laboratory were analyzed. Of these pairs, 59 pairs were identified as re-pairs and used for further descriptive analysis. We found that 50/59 (84.7 %) of re-paired animals gave birth, indicating that reproduction with a new mate is not only possible, but perhaps more common than previously described for this species. Additionally, we found that when re-paired, females took significantly longer to birth a subsequent litter as compared to original breeding pairs. Overall findings from the current study provide evidence for sex differences in reproductive outcomes following repairing and for greater flexibility in mating strategy for a species described as strictly monogamous.\nCitation: Valentino, A., Roy, R., & Becker, E.
